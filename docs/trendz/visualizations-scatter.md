## Compare 2 dimensions
Scatter plot show dependency between few properties of your topology.

In this case you only use **X-axis** and **Y-axis** sections and drop there fields of interest.

## Compare Many dimensions
In case when more than 2 dimensions should be compared, we can group measurements by multiple fields and apply a different colors to each group. 
Here is an example of how it can be used on the same dataset - we compare heat and energy consumption, but apply different color for each floor of each building.
As a result, we see that the first and third floors of Retroville are most energy-efficient and the first floor in Astarta is less efficient.
