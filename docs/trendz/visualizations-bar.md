Details about basic Bar chart you can find in [Line Chart Configuration](/docs/trendz/visualizations-line/)
Main concept for line and bar charts are the same. In this tutorial we will focus on differences.

## Horizontal Bars

By default bar chart is vertical. In some cases it is required to show data using vertical bars. For making it:

* Open View Settings
* Enable **Horizontal Bar** mode

**Note** horizontal mode available only when **Y-axis** contains one field. When multiple fields added to **Y-axis** and there are fields 
in **Series** section - horizontal bar would not display. 

## Stacked Bars

When bar chart contains multiple timeseries or series fields - each seria showed independently. And it is possible to enable 
stacked mode for bar charts. Here are few examples: stacking disabled, stacking enabled and 100% stacked bars.

You can control stack options in View Settings

## Group By telemetry value

This option used when you need to group and aggregate data based on telemetry field value. 
For example we have machine that produce different cups. Machine submit telemetry that contains info:

* How many products were produced (amount)
* What type of product was produced (product category)
* How many resources were utilised (energy)

Raw payload format is the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
  {
    "ts": 1540892498884,
    "amount": 12,
    "product": "glass",
    "energy": 218,
  }
{% endhighlight %}

What we want to find - how many products with different types were produced. Or how much energy was consumed for producing products 
of certain type.

In both cases we need to group telemetry by **product** value and then apply required aggregation (in our case - SUM):

* Add **product** field into **Series** section and select **UNIQ** aggregation - in this step we will group telemetry.
* Add **product** field into **Y-axis** section and select **SUM** aggregation - in this step we apply aggregation for each group.
* Add **Machine** field into **X-axis** section - we will see a breakdown for each machine

Now we now how much products in different categories were produced by different machines.

## Labels
You can add/hide labels from the bar chart using checkbex in View Settings.
